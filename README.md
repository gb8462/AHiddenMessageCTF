# 🔐 AHiddenMessageCTF

[AHiddenMessageCTF](https://ahiddenmessage.pages.dev/) is a small, fun challenge website I built to practice creating CTF-style puzzles and hidden-message mechanics.

This project focuses on **observation, pattern recognition, and patience** rather than brute force or automated tools.

---

## 🧩 What is this?

The website presents users with a strange set of symbols and an innocent-looking block of text.

At first glance, nothing seems out of the ordinary but not everything here is meant to be read at face value.

Somewhere on the page, **there is a hidden message**.
Finding it is only part of the challenge.

## 🗝️ How it works (without spoilers)

- The symbols shown on the page are **not random**.
- They represent encoded information that can be interpreted if you understand how they behave.
- Decoding the symbols will give you something useful.
- That “something” must be **entered manually** there are no copy-paste shortcuts here.

Pay close attention to:
- Patterns
- Repetition
- What looks *invisible* rather than what looks obvious

---

## 🎯 Goal

Your objective is to:
1. Make sense of the symbols
2. Discover the hidden message embedded in the page
3. Use what you found to unlock the final result

No hints will appear automatically this challenge expects curiosity.

## ⚠️ Notes

- This challenge is intentionally minimal.
- No backend exploitation, no network tricks.
- Everything you need is already in front of you.

If you’re stuck, take a break and come back with fresh eyes 👀

## 🛠️ Why I made this

I built this project for fun and as practice in:
- Designing CTF-like challenges
- Hiding information in plain sight
- Frontend puzzle mechanics

Feel free to explore, learn from it, or get inspired to build your own.

Good luck 🍀
